    <h2><em>What's good crÃ¨pe</em></h2>
    <p>
      In France and Belgium, crÃªpes are traditionally served on Candlemas (La
      Chandeleur), February 2nd. This day was originally Virgin Mary's Blessing
      Day but became known in France as "Le Jour des CrÃªpes" (literally
      translated "The Day of the CrÃªpes", and sometimes called colloquially as
      "Avec CrÃªpe Day", "National CrÃªpe Day", or "day of the CrÃªpe"), referring
      to the tradition of offering crÃªpes. The belief was that catching the
      crÃªpe with a frying pan after tossing it in the air with your right hand
      while holding a gold coin in your left hand would cause you to become rich
      that year. The roundness and golden color of a crÃªpe resembles the sun and
      its rays. This symbolism also applies to the coin held in the person's
      hand.
